This is a project implementing face recognition system using PCA on two data sets namely, the Orl dataset (link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tavarez/the-orl-database-for-training-and-testing ) and the Yale dataset (link - http://cvc.cs.yale.edu/cvc/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html). Have implemented the code in MATLAB and have conducted multiple tests on the performance of the model.
